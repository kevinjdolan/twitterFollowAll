I wrote this back in 2009, when I was a Sophomore in Undergrad. I have not used it or updated it since then. I was an okay programmer back then, but I've learned a lot since then so no guarantees on quality here. I'm dumping this here because I am taking down my old blog and a lot of people would download this from there.

Most likely, this no longer works (due to the fact Twitter has changed since 2009).

Released under the WTFPL.

## Original release notes:

Once again, I’d just like to begin by saying you’re welcome.  I’ve recently been experiencing this odd phenomenon– a sudden burst of productivity beginning around 4:00 AM and ending around 6:30.  So last night, I put together this Greasemonkey Script to follow all unfollowed users on a twitter page.

About this Script:

If you don’t already know, Greasemonkey is an addon to Firefox that allows you to run little pieces of code called user scripts inside other websites to customize your experience.  You can find thousands of such user scripts at UserScripts.org.

This is the first Greasemonkey script I’ve written, though I’m quite familiar with JavaScript, so there was no learning curve whatsoever.  The reason I wrote the script was gaining a marketable position on Twitter requires connections, and at a fundamental level, those connections involve getting followers.

One of the best way to gain followers is to follow people somehow already connected to you.  There is a higher chance that these users will follow you back.  Compared to the paid services out there that add thousands of random followers, manually following quality users is still the best way, but it’s tedious.

This script is a middle-ground in the world of auto-twittermation?  Simply install the script, and then everytime you visit someones following/followers list, a box will pop up asking if you want to add all users on the page.  Click it, and your will shall be done.
